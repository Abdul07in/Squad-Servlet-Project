Server is a machine or application capable of handling request and response 
We are using apache tomcat to handle the request and response 

Definations:

1) Servlet is an interface which has all the life cycle methods of a servlet
2) The child class of HttpServlet is also known as a servlet
3) Servlet is a helping technology recived by the server . All servlet are child class of HttpServlet


****Step to make a servlet*****
1] Make a class
2] Extend HttpServlet
3] Make doGet and doPost methods
4] Depending upon where the request is mapped write the code to make dynamic page in doGet or doPost
 	
 	NOTE: by default once a request is mapped always the doGet method is called by server

PrintWritter is a predefined class used to print any data on file or also webpages
to print on web pages we create the object response.getWritter method

To fetch information from input tag if form we call request.getParameter() method
	NOTE: we pass the name of input Tag in the getParameter
	
	.getParameter will always return String object.

Difference between doGet and doPost

1] All information given by user in form is attached in url when form is submitted when doGet is called.
   But When doPost is called information is not attached to url.

2] doGet is usally called to get information from Servlet
   doPost is usually used to send information form page to servlet

3] doGet provides less security
   doPost provides better security
